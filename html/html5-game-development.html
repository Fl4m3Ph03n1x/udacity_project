            <p>
				This course was a true challenge and I have yet completed it with all the merits and distinctions possible. Honestly, this course skips a lot
				of steps and introduces a ton of advanced concepts that I would not recommend to anyone, unless that anyone has some external help.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This course also teaches you how to use Chrome's developer tools, but even that is not enough, as you will eventually need a good environment 
				to develop advanced scripts with JavaScript.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It is still a very interesting course with an awesome project, and for those who complete it, it gives them a cool game to share!
