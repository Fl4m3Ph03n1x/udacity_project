            <strong>Learn all about Web Development with the creator of Reddit!</strong> Steve Huffman tutors you through a series of
            lessons about how to make web applications and what he learned!

            <p>Have you ever heard of <a href="www.reddit.com">reddit</a>? If you have not, now is a wonderful time to discover it! If you
            have, then by now you know that it is one of the biggest websites in the internet, with <a href=
            "http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic">millions of views every month</a>!</p><img alt="Reddit Logo" class=
            "img-responsive" src="../img/Reddit-Logo.jpg">

            <p>But did you know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Huffman">Steve Huffman</a>? This guy is one of the co-founders
            of reddit, and he sure knows what he talks about!</p>

            <p>This course teaches pretty much everything. From HTML, to GSQL and GAE and APIS it covers a lot of ground and teaches a lot
            of skills. This is no doubt an advanced course but beginners can also do it with a lot of hard work. As a master engineer, it
            was a true learning experience!</p>

            <p>This course was one of the longest and hardest I have ever done in Udacity. It is also my favourite by far. With superb
            quizzes, material and a tutor that transpires experience in the web development area each homework was a well thought challenge
            and a true investment of my time. I truly recommend it!</p>
